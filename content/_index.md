        **End of the Road? Autonomous Vehicles and Displacement Risk** (JMP)
        <div class="paper">
        <details class="abstract">
        <summary>{{< icon name="hero/document-text" size="20" >}}Abstract</summary>
        New technologies have motivated renewed concerns about job displacement. In this paper, I link
        workers' subjective displacement expectations to their direct and social exposure to a disruptive
        technology: autonomous vehicles (AVs). I find that commercial driver licensing and employment in
        truck driving fall disproportionately in more AV-exposed areas. The remaining drivers extend their
        work hours and reduce their participation in mortgage markets relative to less-exposed, neighboring
        drivers. Changes in household substance use are consistent with heightened automation-induced anxiety
        and revised beliefs about susceptibility to automation. The results indicate that perceived
        displacement risk affects households' labor supply, credit behavior, and health, all of which could
        inform welfare assessments and policy responses to automation.

        **Relief Beliefs: Effects of Anticipated Student Loan Forgiveness** (with [Xuan Xie](https://sites.google.com/uw.edu/xuanxie/home))
        <div class="paper">
        <details class="abstract">
        <summary>{{< icon name="hero/document-text" size="20" >}}Abstract</summary>
        Political support for student loan forgiveness has been growing, particularly on the left, but evidence
        regarding its effects remains limited. We evaluate the immediate consumption response to President
        Biden's 2022 loan forgiveness announcement which promised debt relief of $10,000 to $20,000 for
        approximately 42 million borrowers. We find that retail stores located in counties with a 1% higher
        share of eligible student loan borrowers saw a persistent 0.1% increase in weekly sales. The positive
        spending response was absent in counties with high shares of financially delinquent households, consistent
        with delinquent borrowers being liquidity constrained and unable to smooth consumption. Novel data on debt
        relief eligibility and applications suggest that student loan borrowers anticipated relief they ultimately
        did not receive and adjusted their spending in response.
